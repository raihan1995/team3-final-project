# Final Project - Team 3

## Project Overview
For this final project, we had to work as a team to deploy a pre-made app as effectively as possible, using the tools and skills that we have been developing over the last 11 weeks. We would also be required to make a presentation to explain the app, all of the steps we took in deploying it and why we chose to do this way. This project allowed for much more freedom in deciding how to achieve the desired goal, and allowed us to make more executive decisions on automation and deployment.  

A secondary focus of this project was to experience working together as a team and managing the workload equally, as this is an invaluable DevOps trait that will not only help to prepare us for interviews, but it will also prepare us for future employment.

## Requirements
You will need to plan, design and implement a solution for automating the development workflows and deployments of this application. As part of your final deliverable you will need to discuss the project in a presentation and demonstrate these workflows.

Using what you have learned, you must determine what tools will work best in the deployment of the application, how to test the application in a working enviroment before pushing any changes to the main branch, how to automatically build changes after they are pushed to the repository and assess the cost of running your application and what steps you can put in place to reduce them.

## What tools will be used?
To complete this project to a high standard I will be using various programs, languages and systems and utilise all of the various tools that they offer. Some of which will be:  

|Tools & programs    |Version         |
|--------------------|----------------|
|Python              |Version 3.8.5   |
|Docker              |Version 20.10.5 |
|Docker-compose      |Version 1.29.0  |
|Jenkins             |Version 2.287   |
|Visual Studio Code  |Version 1.55.0  |
|Terraform           |Version 0.15.1  |
|Kubernetes          |Version 1.21.0  |

## Risk Assessment

### Initial Assessment
Before we began the planning of project we first made an initial risk assessment to make sure that we had a solid plan of what issues we might face whilst completing the project. This would then be updated and added to during the process as there may be errors that we hadn't anticipated to begin with.

### Further Findings


## Planning and Documentation
Over the duration of this project we planned each of the steps we needed to complete by using a Trello kanban board, which meant that everything is clearly laid out, and meant that it was easy to see what's finished and what's still yet to be finished. By doing this, it will ensure that time is managed well and all tasks will be completed in time.

## CI/CD Pipeline
By creating a pipeline diagram it allowed us to get a clearer understanding of what each part of the project was doing, and the order in which the pipeline would be functioning.

## Conclusion

## References
For the most part of this project, any knowledge and skills used had been taught to us by the QA teachers, specifically Vinesh Ghela, Dara Oladapo, Ben Hesketh, Harry Volker, Raji Kolluru, Peter Rhodes and Nathan Forester as well as information from the QA community website and Cloud Academy. On top of this we also used other sources of information on occasion, some of which include:
